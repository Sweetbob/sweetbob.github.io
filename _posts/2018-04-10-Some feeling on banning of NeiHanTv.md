Today is April 10th, 2018. A statement by China broadcast and television Department made a decision to close the NeiHan Tv corporation. There are some feeling by me about this case right here. Why this department(actually represents party and country) have too powerful power to close a company as they just want like this.And there is no way via law,I am wondering if China government don’t like something else concerned with us then they can forbid whatever with no justice and permission of law.It is absolutely crazy and literally about everyone in this country. But what disappointed me is that a lot of people celebrate what  China broadcast and television Department done, it is a little bit interesting, I think so, I wanna know whether these stupid guys don’t know the result of today of NeiHan Tv is exactly their tomorrow.
