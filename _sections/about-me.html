<p>Graduated by CUIT,(actually still a undergraduate if you see me),and what I am doing now is as software developper, accurately focus on bigdata ecosystem. Exceptionally, I am a English leaner. Not only reading books, but also writing diaries, enjoying all of the assets surrounding me. I absolutely believe that what people persently blieve and chase will change the value people have over the life. Go Together and Dream Together!</p>
